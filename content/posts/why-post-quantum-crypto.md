Hi everyone! In this post I talk a little about why is important to start thinking about post-quantum cryptographic algorithms in order to keep our security up-to-date with the development of quantum computers. Hope you like!

## Post-quantum cryptography: Is it something to eat?

We have an expression in brazilian portuguese - "It is something to eat?" - used in situations where someone talks about a non-trivial subject. It means that the others don't even have a superficial knowledge of the conversation topic, so they ask "this what you are talking about... is it something to eat?".

That appears to be the case of post-quantum cryptography. When I say that term to my friends, which are not familiar with computing, they seem to have a similar reaction. At the very least, they associate it with quantum physics, which makes them think it's a terribly difficulty and very distant subject from them.

The main reason of this post is to clarify a little about what the heck is this post-quantum cryptography, and how it can relate to our personal lives somehow in the near future.

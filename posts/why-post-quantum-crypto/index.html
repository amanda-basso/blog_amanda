In this post I talk a little about why is important to start thinking about post-quantum cryptographic algorithms in order to keep our security up-to-date with the development of quantum computers. Hope you like!</p><h2 id=post-quantum-cryptography-is-it-something-to-eat>Post-quantum cryptography: Is it something to eat?</h2><p>We have an expression in brazilian portuguese - &ldquo;It is something to eat?&rdquo; - used in situations where someone talks about a non-trivial subject. It means that the others don&rsquo;t even have a superficial knowledge of the conversation topic, so they ask &ldquo;this what you are talking about&mldr; is it something to eat?&rdquo;.</p><p>That appears to be the case of post-quantum cryptography. When I say that term to my friends, which are not familiar with computing, they seem to have a similar reaction. At the very least, they associate it with quantum physics, which makes them think it&rsquo;s a terribly difficulty and very distant subject from them.</p><p>The main reason of this post is to clarify a little about what the heck is this post-quantum cryptography, and how it can relate to our personal lives somehow in the near future.</p><h2 id=first-things-first-why-is-classical-cryptography-important>First things first: why is classical cryptography important</h2></div></main></body></html>
